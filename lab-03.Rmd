### Load packages

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```


# Questioning data visualisations

## Image 1

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Speaking-the-world.jpg")
```

_china has misleading notation and should be using millions to be inline with the rest of the data. there is also an inconsistent scale to the bars._





## Image 2

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rose-pop-density-total-area-bw.jpg")
```

_no infomation about how to read the graph and no figures. probably not the best graph choice for the data._




## Image 3

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/life-expectancy-rule-of-law.png")
```

_points overlapping making it hard to read. what is the rule of law axis?_




## Image 4

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/global-income-dist.PNG")
```

_confusing axis._





# Exercises

```{r load-data-staff, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
```


## Exercise 1

What is the difference between *wide format* data and *long format* data?


Is the format `staff` data *wide* or *long*?


How many observations are there in the data set?




## Exercise 2

```{r pivoting}
## Uncomment and complete the following code

#staff_long <- ___ %>%
#  ___(
#    cols = ____, 
#    names_to = "_____",
#    values_to = "percent"
#    )

```


## Exercise 3

```{r dot-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 3 here



```

## Exercise 4

```{r bad-line-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 4 here



```

## Exercise 5

```{r mutate-year}
## Uncomment and complete the following code

#staff_long <- staff_long %>%
#  mutate(year = ______(year))
```


```{r working-line-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 5 here



```

## Exercise 6

```{r better-line-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 6 here




```

## Exercise 7

_Write below your ideas for adapting the line plot_

* Idea 1
* Idea 2
* Idea 3
* ...


## Exercise 8

```{r implement-Ex7}
# Write your code for Exercise 8 here



```
